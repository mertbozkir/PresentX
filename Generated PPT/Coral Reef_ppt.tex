The oceans absorb about a quarter of the carbon dioxide produced by humans, which causes the pH of the oceans to drop. \item This makes it harder for coral to extract calcium carbonate from the water to build their skeletons. \end{itemize} \end{frame}\begin{frame}{Coral Reefs: Advantages} \begin{itemize} \item Coral reefs provide a home to thousands of marine species. \item Coral reefs are a source of food for millions of people. \item Coral reefs are a source of income through tourism. \end{itemize} \end{frame}\begin{frame}{Dangers to Coral Reefs} \begin{itemize} \item Overfishing \item Pollution \item Acidification \end{itemize} \end{frame}\end{document}
